# Codepath Unit 6 - *LAB*
 Codepath Unit 6 Lab for class COP4655-001

Submitted by: **Kyler Mallonn**

**Unit 6 Lab** is an app that is similar to instagram that allows a user to create a new account and sign in, and create, save, and view posts using [back4app](https://www.back4app.com/) API. You can only view posts that are less than 24 hours long and all other posts are blurred until you create a post, which resets after 24 hours.
